<h1>🐦 Testing-Lovebird: Heuristic Optimization for TSP</h1>
This repository contains a Python implementation of Lovebird Algorithm and its hybrid variant using Iterated Local Search (ILS), applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It is designed as part of an academic research project to benchmark and explore the capabilities of Lovebird in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

<h2>🔍 Features</h2>
- ✅ Implementation of Lovebird Algorithm for TSP
- ♻️ Hybrid version: Lovebird + Iterated Local Search (ILS)
- 📊 Performance visualization with convergence plots
- 🧪 Tested on real benchmark datasets from TSPLIB: fri26, att48, kroA100
- 🔄 Modular code structure for easy experimentation

<h2>🎓 Purpose</h2>
This project was developed as part of an undergraduate research initiative to explore and evaluate heuristic and metaheuristic approaches for solving TSP, focusing on the performance of Lovebird variants.
